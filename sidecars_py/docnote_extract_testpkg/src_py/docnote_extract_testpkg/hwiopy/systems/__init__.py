#            repo_id='Badg/hwiopy',
#            pkg_name='hwiopy',
#            offset_dest_root_dir=None,
#            root_path='hwiopy',
#            commit_hash='c6536bc4e1c410f835def3847e1881f2d7f0c076',
#            license_paths={'LICENSE.txt'})

# The license of the original project is included in the top level of
# the vendored project directory.

# To regenerate, see sidecars/docnote_extract_testpkg_factory. The
