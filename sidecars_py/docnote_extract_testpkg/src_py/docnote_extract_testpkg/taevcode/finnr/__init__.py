# This is a programmatically-vendored code sample
# that has been stubbified (ie, function bodies removed). Do not modify
# it directly; your changes will just be overwritten.

# The original source is:
# PkgSrcSpec(forge='github',
#            repo_id='Taev-dev/finnr',
#            pkg_name='finnr',
#            offset_dest_root_dir='taevcode',
#            root_path='src_py/finnr',
#            commit_hash='5a58ed0fc95b068ae396ce3adea91ca66cabe169',
#            license_paths=set())

# The license of the original project is included in the top level of
# the vendored project directory.

# To regenerate, see sidecars/docnote_extract_testpkg_factory. The
# command is:
# ``uv run python -m docnote_extract_testpkg_factory``.
